class RAMB2(Player): #b2
    
    """
    B2 player that relies on similar lexicographic strategy as B1, but skips over some guesses. 
    Please refer to the B1 documentation to understand the for loops; they are used again to change 
    the color at an index after a certain number of guesses has passed. B2 has code that allows it to 
    skip over colors that have been ruled out. After making the first guess, there last_response 
    is checked to see if the previous guess produced '0 0 (guess number).' If such is the case, 
    then no colors were correct in that guess and should not appear in subsequent guesses. The while 
    loop continues producing guesses until it produces one that has no colors that were determined 
    to be invalid. If the previous guess did not have '0 0 (guess number)' then a different while 
    loop cycles through the guesses in a similar manner until an acceptable one is produced. Honestly, 
    the code could have been written using a single while loop, since they esentially do the same 
    thing, but because of errors during testing this longer version was opted for.
