"""
Note: As requested by the Professor, this is a note explaining our group's situation. Our team captain 
was responsible for the Mystery SCSA code as well as B3. Unfortunately, he dropped the class and 
let the rest of us know very last minute, on the day that D3 was due. The Mystery SCSA code had no 
documentation, so the rest of the members could not completely understand it, and it performed 
quite badly against the partially observable SCSAs. For this reason, we decided to do away with 
his code and setteled for the UsuallyFewer code, which performs decently against the mysteries. 
This is true save for mystery5, which we use the TwoColorAlternating code for. As for B3, the professor 
has granted an extension for it. We hope that the complications that our group has faced is taken 
into consideration when grading, but also understand the guidelines for fair grading.

            guess number, the number of color in colors, and the numbers ranging from 1 board_length 
            in order to proceed lexicographically without the use of excessive globals. The first guess 
            is always all As. After this, a for loop checks whether a certain number of guesses 
            has passed. Some letter change in the indices other than the last index occurs for every 
            guess number divisible by the number of colors. For example, consider 4 colors and a board. 
            A letter change will occur at every 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, and 4^3 = 64 guess, where each exponent 
            corresponds to the value of i in the for loop. If the guess number is divisible by, say, 64, 
            then the color at some index must be changed. This index is given by color[(board_length-1)-i],
